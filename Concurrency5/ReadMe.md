This application simulates on-demand street lighting in one direction for 8 street lamps on a road. The user selects (simulated) vehicle arrival times at the first pole. The position of each vehicle is considered to be either (1) prior to this stretch of road, (2) past it, or (3) at a pole. The simulation assumes that vehicles take one second to travel from one pole to the next. The application reports the status of all vehicles approximately every half-second, showing the street light as being lit wherever a vehicle is located, as well as one pole ahead of a vehicleâ€”otherwise off.
