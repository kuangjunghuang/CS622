This project concerns a system for students to learn written material that is between a paragraph and several pages in length. To use the system, called Knowla, students respond to a question by selecting from and ordering a set of fragments (typically sentences). Since material thatâ€™s more than a page in length contains too many sentences to re-order, we envision a system that first requires ordering paragraph topics, and after that the sentences within each paragraph. The focus of the term project is the automatic grading of solutions to Knowla tests. This grading system will be called K-Grade.
