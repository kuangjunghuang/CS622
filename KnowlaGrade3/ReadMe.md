Knowla (Knowledge assessment and learning) is a scrambling/unscrambling tool for instructors and students to learn material that is between a paragraph and several pages in length. Knowla facilitates testing on the material and being automatically graded, which is the focus of this project.
This project concerns the grading of Knowla tests, which we will call K-Grade. K-Grade allows the instructor to assign points to qualities that they want in students answers—expressed in terms of rubric sets. The grading philosophy is to assign only positive points for designated favorable qualities in the test-taker’s answer (i.e., not to subtract for deficiencies).
