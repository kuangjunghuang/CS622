 REQUIREMENTS
 
 Grades a student answer to a scrambled set of text fragments.
 The problem is given as a set sentences, known to the grading system by number, such as 3 4 7 11 2 5 1.
 The answer is of the form 1 2 3 4 (i.e., does not necessarily include all fragments).
 The system uses rubric sets to evaluate an answer. For example, the "order" rubrics are associated
 with the class OrderRubrics--where the specifications of an associated file are specified.
